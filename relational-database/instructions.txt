The goal of this assignment was to create a mock relational database of the type a university might use to track students, courses, instructors, and grades. The database was first diagrammed using LucidChart, then created in Microsoft Access. The purpose of the assignment was to demonstrate a student's knowledge of relational database concepts such as primary, foreign, and composite keys; proper usage of database design software such as Microsoft Access; and knowledge of diagramming conventions and scalability considerations that go into designing a database.
