Soccer Team Roster

This program will store roster and rating information for a soccer team. Coaches rate players during tryouts to ensure a balanced team. Given a player's jersey number (0 - 99) and rating (1 - 9), you will need to:

Prompt the user to input any number of pairs of numbers: a player's jersey number (0 - 99) and the player's rating (1 - 9). Store the jersey numbers in one array and the ratings in another array.

Implement a menu of options for a user to modify the roster. Each option is represented by a single character. The program initially outputs the menu, and the program ends when the user chooses the option to Quit.

- Output roster - Prints the roster
- Update player rating - Prompts the user for a player's jersey number. If the player is in the roster, then prompts again for a new rating for the player. Updates that player's rating. If the player is not in the roster, prints "Player not in roster."
- Output players above a rating - Prompts the user for a rating. Prints the jersey number and rating for all players with ratings above the entered value.
- Replace player - Prompts the user for the jersey number of the player to replace. If the player is in the roster, then prompts again for a new jersey number and rating. Updates the replaced player's jersey number and rating. If the player is not in the roster, prints "Player not in roster."

For full credit, you must use proper formatting (indentation and whitespace) and include appropriate comments in your code.
