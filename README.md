# assignments
An assortment of assignments/homework/etc I've completed in class are uploaded here (along with instructions/purpose of the assignment, for context) as one portion of a "portfolio." Each assignment has its own folder within the repository. Some of these assignments are ones I felt proud of at the time and had invested a lot of time and effort into; others were intentionally chosen because they are not my best work - their purpose is to show progression in skill over time.

To retain confidentiality, instructors, class titles, information about the curriculum, or the university will not be listed. That information will only be available in a professional capacity.
